# 🩺 Healthcare Intelligence Project: A Data-Driven Approach Using Python & SQL

Welcome to one of my personal data analytics showcase projects! This end-to-end healthcare analysis demonstrates how SQL and Python can be leveraged to extract actionable insights from raw hospital records. The project combines hands-on querying, data wrangling, and real-world business thinking in a healthcare context — a perfect blend of data and domain.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world healthcare scenario by analyzing structured datasets involving patient admissions, diagnoses, hospital charges, BMI trends, and smoking-related health impacts. The goal is to identify cost drivers, patterns in patient care, and areas for strategic improvement — all powered by SQL queries and Python analysis.

The datasets used represent:
- **Patient health and demographic records**
- **Medical procedures and hospitalization history**
- **Billing and insurance details**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (PostgreSQL flavor): For slicing through large tables with JOINs and GROUP BY analysis.
- **Python**: Data processing and visualization using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For structuring a reproducible analysis workflow.
- **Streamlit (optional)**: For turning analysis into interactive web dashboards.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Understand cost distribution across patient segments.
- Identify high-risk individuals based on BMI, smoking, and surgery history.
- Visualize trends in hospitalization and health spending over time.
- Build a modular SQL pipeline that can be adapted for other business verticals.

## 📈 Notable Insights & Findings

🔍 The analysis uncovered:

1. **High-value patients**: Those with high BMI or multiple surgeries drive significantly higher costs.
2. **Surgical impact**: Patients with major surgeries have an average charge ~2.5x more than non-surgical ones.
3. **City & hospital tier trends**: Charges vary sharply by hospital and city tier — Tier-1 cities observe consistently higher billing rates.
4. **Health patterns**:
   - Smokers undergoing transplants are a small but high-cost group.
   - 1995 saw the highest average BMI among all city tiers.
5. **Yearly hospitalization trends**: The year with the most hospitalizations was **2001**, with sharp declines post-2003.
6. **Top paying patients**:
   - A handful of customers are responsible for a large chunk of charges.
   - Top 3 customers had average yearly charges exceeding $18,000.
